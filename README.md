**CAR PRICE PREDICTION USING AUTO-REGRESSION MODEL**

**Objective:**
- **To Predict Car Prices** based on the **Type of Fuel**, **Kilometers Driven**, and the **Year of the Model** using an **Auto Regression Model**.

**Methodology:**
1. **Data Source:**
   - **Dataset:** **Quikr Car Sales Data**.
   - **Models Used:** **Linear, Non-Linear**, and **Classification Models** were built and evaluated for accuracy.
2. **Preprocessing Steps:**
   - **Format Adjustment:** Converted the **Year** column from **object** to **integer** using `.astype(int)`.
   - **Price Cleanup:** Removed non-numeric values (e.g., **"Ask for Price"**) and commas, followed by converting to **integer**.
   - **Kilometer Cleanup:** Stripped **"kms"** from **Kms Driven** values and converted to **integer**.
   - **Handling Missing Data:** **NaN** values in **Fuel_Type** were removed.

3. **Model Creation:**
   - **Simple Linear Regression Model** was created to predict car prices.
   - **Prediction Function:** The **pipe.predict()** function was used to estimate **Car Price** based on the independent variables: **Type of Fuel**, **Kilometers Driven**, and the **Year** of the model.

**Data Visualizations:**
- **Visualizing Relationships:**
   - **Company vs. Price**
   - **Year vs. Price**
   - **Kilometers Driven vs. Price**
   - **Fuel Type vs. Price**
   - **Fuel Type, Year, and Company** combined in a **Multi-variable Plot**.

**Model Comparison:**
- **Train/Test Split:** Used the **train_test_split()** method from **sklearn.model_selection** to divide the data into training and testing sets.
- **Handling Categorical Data:** Applied **OneHotEncoder** to handle **Fuel_Type** and other categorical variables.

**Accuracy Metrics:**
- **R-Squared and Adjusted R-Squared:** Chose **Adjusted R-Squared** to measure how well the model fits the data, with **Random State** tuning to maximize accuracy.

**Prediction From Training Dataset:**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b94473e5-548e-4edf-bf54-79b10a3ce277)

- **Car:** **2006 Toyota Corolla**.
   - **Kilometers Driven:** 5100.
   - **Fuel Type:** Petrol.
   - **Predicted Price:** **â‚¹428,873.63** (Four Hundred Twenty-Eight Thousand, Eight Hundred Seventy-Three Rupees).

**Conclusion:**
- The model provides a reliable estimate of car prices with a high degree of accuracy based on essential independent variables.
